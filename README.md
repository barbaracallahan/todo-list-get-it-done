# todo-list-get-it-done

This challenge was created by Tyler Potts, and built and edited by me (barbara). Is a Todo List built with Html, css and javascript. 

it's a great tool to stay organized and keep track of your progress throught the week/day, and make all actions count. I'm very happy how it turned out, but I still wanna make some changes in the future, such as adding videos to help our users to stay organized, and more educational content. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy as much as I did.
